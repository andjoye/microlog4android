The project is now in the startup phase and as such we do not have much to write here.


= Todo =

These are the things that is needed to be done within the microlog4android.

For V1.0:

  * Write build script (Gradle)
  * Code cleanup
  * Implement configuration. A new PropertyConfigurator maybe.
  * Write a new FileAppender
  * Write a HTTPAppender

Future versions:
  * Write SyslogAppender.
