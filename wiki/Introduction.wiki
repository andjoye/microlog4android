#labels Todo
= Introduction =

The project is now in the startup phase and as such we do not have much to write here.


= Todo =

These are the things that is needed to be done within the microlog4android.

For V1.0:

  * Write build script (Gradle)
  * Code cleanup
  * Implement configuration. A new PropertyConfigurator maybe? Automatic configuration?
  * Write a new FileAppender
  * Write an EmailAppender or similar
  * Write a HTTPAppender

Future versions:
  * Optimize for use in a Java SE environment. For example replace Vector usage with a List implementation. Replace Hashtables with Map etc etc.
  * Make the PatternFormatter support new features to make it compatible with the PatternLayout in Log4j. In other words implement features that was not possible in Java ME.
  * Write SyslogAppender?
  * Write a Google App Engine Appender?
  * Would it be possible to create a BluetoothAppender? Should it be useful? The USB connection works well.
